table
=====
a table data structure for fast access in both dimensions. Thoroughly unit tested (the tests are included). I had originally written this for use in my `jeopardy` webapp, but I don't recall if I actually used it.

This code was originally in the `useful-packages` repo, but I decided to break it up.
